That is a specific bug that allows writing to memory pages and forcing the OS to write those changes to disk. I was not able to get this to work, but I believe it is an option in this challenge. I opted for the very simple solution of finding all executables that had the SUID bit set in the file permissions. If this bit is set, and you have permission to execute that file you will essentially be executing that file as the root user.
