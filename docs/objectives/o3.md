    Hey, welcome to Santa's Surf Shack on tropical Christmas Island! I'm just hanging ten here, taking it easy while brushing up on my Linux skills.

You ever tried getting into Linux? It's a super cool way to play around with computers.

Can you believe ChatNPT suggested this trip to the Geese Islands this year? I'm so thrilled!

Kudos to ChatNPT, eh? The sunshine, the waves, and my surfboard â€“ simply loving it!

So, what do you have planned? Care to join me in a Linux session?

## Solution

Solving this challenge is to simply search for the correct commands if you don't know them already. All of the questions that are asked are common Linux/Unix commands. (I didn't bother to write down the commands at the time. TODO)

## Response

    Wow, if your surfing skills are as good as your Linux skills, you could be winning competitions!
