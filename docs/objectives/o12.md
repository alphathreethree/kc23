## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Shifty McShuffles is hustling cards on Film Noir Island. Outwit that meddling elf and win!

??? quote "Shifty McShuffles"
    Hey there, stranger! Fancy a game of cards? Luck's on your side today, I can feel it.

Step right up, test your wit! These cards could be your ticket to fortune.

Trust me, I've got a good eye for winners, and you've got the look of luck about you.

Plus, I'd wager you've never played this game before, as this isn't any ordinary deck of cards. It's made with Python.

The name of the game is to bamboozle the dealer.

So whad'ya think? Are you clever enough?

## Hints

??? tip "Stump the Chump"
    Try to outsmart Shifty by sending him an error he may not understand.

??? tip "The Upper Hand"
    Shifty said his deck of cards is made with Python. Surely there's a weakness to give you the upper hand in his game.

## Solution

The solution to this is to take advantage in a Python bug that causes unexpected behavior when tyring to use the float() function on NaN (not a number). I first confirmed this worked by using Burpsuite to capture the POST message I was going to send with my card numbers. Manually changed each number to "NaN" and saw that I was able to win the hand.<br><Br>
You can not get the achievment doing this outside of the game though. You must use Firefox Web Developer Tools, console, to change the card values for each hand. The values are stored in an array: cardArray2[i].cardtext.text

## Response

    Well, you sure are more clever than most of the tourists that show up here.

I couldn't swindle ya, but don't go telling everyone how you beat me!

An elf's gotta put food on the table somehow, and I'm doing the best I can with what I got.
