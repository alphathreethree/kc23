    Eve Snowshoes is trying to recover a password. Head to the Island of Misfit Toys and take a crack at it!

??? quote "Eve Snowshoes"
    I'm Eve Snowshoes, resident tech hobbyist, and I hear Alabaster is in quite the predicament.

Our dear Alabaster forgot his password. He's been racking his jingle bells of memory with no luck.

I've been trying to handle this password recovery thing parallel to this hashcat business myself but it seems like I am missing some tricks.

So, what do you say, chief, ready to get your hands on some hashcat action and help a distraught elf out?

## Solution

This solution was to determine the hash type by looking it up on the hashcat website. The results are: 18200 	Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP. The cracked password password is listed in .hashcat/hashcat.potfile

### Code blocks

hashcat --force -D 1 -m 18200 -w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1 hash.txt password_list.txt
```
