??? quote "Piney Sappington"
    Hey there, friend! Piney Sappington here.

You look like someone who's good with puzzles and games.

I could really use your help with this Elf Hunt game I'm stuck on.

I think it has something to do with manipulating JWTs, but I'm a bit lost.

If you help me out, I might share some juicy secrets I've discovered.

Let's just say things around here haven't been exactly... normal.

So, what do ya say? Are you in?

Oh, brilliant! I just know we'll crack this game together.

I can't wait to see what we uncover, and remember, mum's the word!

Thanks a bunch! Keep your eyes open and your ears to the ground.

## Hints

??? tip "JWT Secrets Revealed"
    Unlock the mysteries of JWTs with insights from PortSwigger's JWT Guide.

??? tip "Insert Hint 2 Title"
    Along the way you will receive different hints. Insert them here.

## Solution

I completed this challenge by just playing the game. The proper solution is to use web sockets and abusing JWT, I assume (todo).

    Well done! You've brilliantly won Elf Hunt! I couldn't be more thrilled. Keep up the fine work, my friend!

What have you found there? The Captain's Journal? Yeah, he comes around a lot. You can find his comms office over at Brass Buoy Port on Steampunk Island.
