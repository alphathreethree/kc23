??? quote "Tangle Coalbox"
    Greetings, rookie. Tangle Coalbox of Kusto Detective Agency here.

I've got a network infection case on Film Noir Island that needs your expertise.

Seems like someone clicked a phishing link within a client's organization, and trouble's brewing.

I'm swamped with cases, so I need an extra pair of hands. You up for the challenge?

You'll be utilizing the Azure Data Explorer and those KQL skills of yours to investigate this incident.

Before you start, you'll need to create a free cluster.

Keep your eyes peeled for suspicious activity, IP addresses, and patterns that'll help us crack this case wide open.

Remember, kid, time is of the essence. The sooner we can resolve this issue, the better.

If you run into any problems, just give me a holler, I've got your back.

Good hunting, and let's bring this cyber criminal to justice.

Once you've got the intel we need, report back and we'll plan our next move. Stay sharp, rookie.
