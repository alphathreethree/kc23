# Space Island Door Access Speaker (submitted after deadline)

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective 19 terminal](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    There's a door that needs opening on Space Island! Talk to Jewel Loggins there for more information.

??? quote "Jewel Loggins"
    What are you doing here, and who are you?

Me first? I'm Jewel Loggins. And I was trekking through the jungle and happened to find this place.

I liked this spot and decided to set up camp. Seeing you here is quite the surprise.

Well, because the only other person I've ever seen come here is Wombley Cube.

I thought this tram station in the middle of the jungle was strange to begin with, but then Wombley added to the intrigue.

I guess all this spy stuff is typical for him, so maybe I shouldn't think much of it. I'm sure everything's fine.

Every time he comes here, he says something to the speaker. Then, the door opens, and he rides the tram somewhere.

I gave it a try, but the door didn't open for me. Knowing Wombley, it's some kind of secret passphrase.

If you wanna see where the tram goes, I think you need to find out what that passphrase is.

Ribb Bonbowford over at Coggoggle Marina on Steampunk Island works with Wombley. Try asking if he knows.

I hope you find it. I'll be here when you get back!

## Hints

??? tip "MFA: Something You Know"
    Wombley says a specific phrase into the Access Speaker. He works in the Research Department and everything they do it super secret, so it may be a challenge to find out what the phrase is. Ribb also works in that department. Try to find and ask him.
