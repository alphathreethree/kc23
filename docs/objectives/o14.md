## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Fitzy Shortstack on Film Noir Island needs help battling dastardly phishers. Help sort the good from the bad!

??? quote "Fitzy Shortstack"
    Just my luck, I thought...

A cybersecurity incident right in the middle of this stakeout.

Seems we have a flood of unusual emails coming in through ChatNPT.

Got a nagging suspicion it isn't catching all the fishy ones.

You're our phishing specialist right? Could use your expertise in looking through the output of ChatNPT.

Not suggesting a full-blown forensic analysis, just mark the ones screaming digital fraud.

We're looking at all this raw data, but sometimes, it takes a keen human eye to separate the chaff, doesn't it?

I need to get more powdered sugar for my donuts, so do ping me when you have something concrete on this.
