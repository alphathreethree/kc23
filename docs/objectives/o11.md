# Game Cartridges: Vol 3 (submitted after deadline)

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [ROM](https://gamegosling.com/vol3-7bNwQKGBFNGQT1/rom/game.gb)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Find the third Gamegosling cartridge and beat the game

## Hints

??? tip "Bird's Eye View"
    The location of the treasure in Rusty Quay is marked by a shiny spot on the ground. To help with navigating the maze, try zooming out and changing the camera angle.

??? tip "Gameboy 3 - Angel Canydalt"
    1) This one is a bit long, it never hurts to save your progress! 2) 8bit systems have much smaller registers than you’re used to. 3) Isn’t this great?!? The coins are OVERFLOWing in their abundance.

## Solution

I believe the solution is to use Ghidra to find the location in code where the score is being written, then modify the game.gb binary so that the score is always '999'. You can not play the game and get to 999; it will overload and roll over starting from 0. Did not complete.
